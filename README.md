# How to Use the violentmonkey quickclip script

## step 1: Install the violentmonkey extension

You can get the Version for Chrome Based Browsers from the Google Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag
(Will also work for Brave, Opera, and other Chromium based browsers, simply just install the extension as if you were on chrome!)

The Firefox extension version can be installed here https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/
(note: This script is untested on firefox)

## step 2: Install the script

A word of caution: ViolentMonkey scripts are very handy but are also capable of being used for malicious purposes if you get tricked into installing bad code.

MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY INSTALL THE SCRIPT THAT IS OUTLINED HERE AS IT ONLY DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO AND NOTHING MORE.

IF IN DOUBT, ALWAYS ASK FOR SOMEONE KNOWLEDGEABLE TO REVIEW THIS SCRIPT. 

With that out of the way, first click on the link to open quickclip.js

A new page with the quickclick.js code will pop up, make sure that you click on the "copy raw file button" to copy the entire code.

Next, click on the violent monkey extension and then click on the plus symbol as outlined in the screenshot below

A new tab will appear with some lines of text, make sure to clear out all the lines of text, then paste the code into the window, it should look like this

Once done, hit save and close at the top right corner of the script window

and presto! you have installed the violentmonkey script!


## Using the Script.

Step 1: Navigate to any youtube video, livestream or not, it does not matter. You'll notice that the tampermonkey extension starts lighting up, that means the script is now active.
If you don't see it light up, you may want to re-check to see if the script was installed properly.

Step 2: When you find a segment of a youtube video or live that you want to clip, push 'Alt+C' on your keyboard. You will see a message briefly popup over the video saying that "values have been copied to clipboard"
If you don't see this message popup, make sure that you have focused the window and tab with the youtube video you're attempting to clip, and then try again.

Step 3: Then navigate over to discord and pull up the /createclip slash command, a box labelled input should appear, the values you need to enter should already be saved on your "clipboard" at this point.
All you have to do is right-click and paste (or ctrl+v) inside of the input box. Once you have done that, push enter to execute the command and GrounderBot will return an approximately 15 second long clip.
Please note that the script is programmed to record up to 15 seconds before the current video time.
